THIS IS THE CHANGELOG OF THE "micEconCES" PACKAGE

Please note that only the most significant changes are reported here.
A full ChangeLog is available in the log messages of the SVN repository
on R-Forge.


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9-6   (2012-01-03)

* the user can determine further details of the graph that is
produced by the plot() method

* added CITATION file (referring to the working paper)

* the source code of the vignette is in subfolder /vignettes/ now


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9-2   (2011-06-04)

* improved the vignette


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9-0   (2011-05-23)

* cesCalc() and cesEst() can account for technological change

* cesEst() can estimate CES functions by assuming that the error term is 
multiplicative (i.e. taking the residuals from the logged model)

* cestEst() additionally returns the constant elasticity/elasticities of 
substitution and print.cesEst() additionally prints the constant 
elasticity/elasticities of substitution

* summary.cestEst() additionally returns the variance/covariance matrix, 
standard error(s), t-value(s) and P-value(s) of the constant 
elasticity/elasticities of substitution and print.summary.cesEst() 
additionally prints the constant elasticity/elasticities of substitution 
as well as the corresponding standard error(s), t-value(s), and P-value(s)

* the 3-input nested CES function no longer has coefficient "gamma_1", because 
it is obsolete and cannot be identified in econometric estimations

* renamed some coefficients of the 3-input and 4-input nested CES functions

* added data set "GermanIndustry"

* the package vignette additionally describes the features regarding the 
3-input and 4-input nested CES functions



            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.8-0   (2010-12-13)

* added support for nested CES functions with 3 or 4 inputs


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-8

* reduced execution time of the examples by removing several examples and by
decreasing the number of iterations in the (example) estimations that use the
SANN and the DE algorithm


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-6

* fixed a bug in the package vignette


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-4

* added a "vignette" describing this package; it has the title "Estimating
  the CES Function in R: Package micEconCES" and it was written by Geraldine
  Henningsen and Arne Henningsen

* the test scripts cesTest.R, cesTestGrid.R, and rhoFixed.R as well as
  the corresponding output files have been excluded from the R package
  (using .Rbuildignore) to reduce the execution time of "R CMD check"
  on CRAN (these scripts are still included in the SVN repository)


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-2

* initial release of this package

* the function "cesEst", its documentation, and the test script
  have been moved from the "micEcon" package to this package

* function "cesCalc" for calculating the endogenous (output) variable
  of the CES function has been added

* a lot of features (e.g. estimation methods), (S3) methods, and test scripts
  have been added
